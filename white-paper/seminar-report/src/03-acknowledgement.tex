I'm excited as I present this report on \emph{Open AI GPT-3} as part of the final year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering seminar. Allow me to take this opportunity to first thank the God Almighty for providing His grace and guidance in this dispensation.

Sincere thanks to \emph{Dr. Brilly S Sangeetha}, Principal, for providing all the required facilities to make this a great success. I acknowledge, with all respect, the encouraging presence of \emph{Dr. Kriuthiga G}, Head of the Department, all along the way. I stand with unspeakable gratitude to my guide \emph{Mr. Ebin P M}, Assistant Professor, for his motivation, attention, and support all time.

Last but not the least, I convey my warm regards to all the well wishers, family members and friends who have helped me during needed times.
