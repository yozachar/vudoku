- Analysis is based on extracting a set of features from a hand image and then combining them by using an induction graph.
- Apply a fuzzy classifier to identify the skin pixels.
- Remove all the hand components except the fingers.
- The final step consists on representing histogram of the detected fingers in order to extract features that will be used for digit recognition.

# Multi-digit Number Recognition from Street View Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

## 14 April 2014

> Ahmed Ben Jmaa | Walid Mahdi | Yousra Ben Jemaa | Abdelmajid Ben Hmadou

- Traditional approaches is to separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps.
- Unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels.
- Employs the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images.

- Claims to create a base for future researches in the area so that the researchers can overcome the existing problems.
- Focuses on digit recognition using multilayer neural network.
- It mainly comprises of three phases that is pre-processing phase, feature extraction and then the final phase of classification.

# An ensemble of simple convolutional neural network models for MNIST digit recognition

- They report a very high accuracy on the MNIST test set that can be achieved by using simple convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
- Uses three different models with different kernel size in the convolution layers, each followed by a single fully connected layer.
- A two-layer ensemble, a heterogeneous ensemble of three homogeneous ensemble networks, can achieve up to 99.91% test accuracy.

- Claim reliance on CNNâ€™s is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform.
- Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks.
- Requires substantially fewer computational resources to train.
