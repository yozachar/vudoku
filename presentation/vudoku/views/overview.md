# Overview & Prerequisites

## Why Digit Recognition?

- It’s simple. (A classic example to begin with)

- A lot of work has been done in this field.

- Recommendation. Intuition. A gut feeling.

## Fourier Transform

A mathematical transform that decomposes a function (often a function of time, or a signal) into its constituent frequencies.

## Gradient Descent

It’s  first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function

## Activation Function

Defines the output of that node (usually a neuron) given an input or set of inputs. Sigmoid, ReLU etc.

## Attention

What part of the input should I focus on? Relevance of one entity with respect to others entities

## Back Propagation

Is an algorithm, used to train feed-forward neural networks for supervised learning

## Hitting Set Problem

To find minimum cardinality subset of an arbitrary bipartite graph, with sets and the universe  representing the inclusion of elements in sets
